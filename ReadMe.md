## The problem:

Owing to the daily busy schedule of individuals, we often put our health aside and flow with the work or anything pertaining to it.

## Idea and concept:

- We came up with the idea that if a person while eating, sleeping (on the verge to), walking or strolling etc. can get the benefits same as that of a check-up! 
- Plus all the health freaks out there who are strict with their diet can also use another of the main feature of this app where in scanning the food item, will reveal its nutrients. 
- So right amount of diet is available, short in-hand check-up is available and what more do you want to stay healthy!? This app comprises of two features: check-up and reveal of nutrients (and hence the name NutriVeal!) 
- For check-up fill up a short form and it will reveal all the abnormalities with the user if any, like any deficiencies and all such. 
- For nutrients revealing, scan the concerned food item with your mobile camera and it will instantlt display on your screen all the nutrients facts about that item.

## Summary:
In short it works as a kind of an offline google suggestion of health related things kind of app, so pretty much you have your health in your control, in case of severity it will advice you to visit the nearest specialist!
